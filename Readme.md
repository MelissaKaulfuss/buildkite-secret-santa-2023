[Buildkite](https://buildkite.com/)â€™s Secret Santa 2016 build pipeline, to find out xmas pressie hints from everyone, and notify each of us with who weâ€™re buying for and what their hint was.

## How does it work?

The build pipeline:

* [pipeline/pipeline.bash](pipeline/pipeline.bash) - generates the Buildkite pipeline that requests Secret Santa hints from everyone
* [pipeline/readme.bash](pipeline/readme.bash) - the first step in the pipeline that welcomes everyone to this yearâ€™s Secret Santa
* [pipeline/magical-unicorns.bash](pipeline/magical-unicorns.bash) - the last step in the pipeline: a brilliantly red magical unicorn

The webhook receiver:

* [notifier/index.js](notifier/index.js) - accepts the `job.finished` webhook from Buildkite, randomly assigns secret santaâ€™s, and emails everyone with the hint and delivery address
